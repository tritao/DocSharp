DocSharp
========
.NET semantic documentation generator.

Why?
----

I tried a couple of .NET documentation generators but either they were weird to use or did not provide the features I am looking: cleanliness of the generated output, easy customization and support for custom pages with Markdown, useful for writing user manuals and even whole static websites.

Can I use it yet?
-----------------

The project is in a development state and should not be generally used yet.
